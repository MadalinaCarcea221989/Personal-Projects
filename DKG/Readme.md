# 📊 Predicting Big Clusters – AI for Production Planning

This project explores the use of machine learning for **trend forecasting** in production environments. It focuses on identifying **high-demand periods** based on historical order data, allowing companies like DKG to make smarter and faster decisions regarding inventory and production planning.

---

## 🚀 Objective

Develop an AI-driven model that predicts **big purchasing clusters** throughout the year to:
- Improve decision-making
- Optimize production scheduling
- Prevent stockouts and overstock
- Enhance customer satisfaction

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key findings:
- Delivery dates (requested vs actual) were highly aligned → consistent delivery behavior
- Count per item & article types revealed key selling patterns
- Minimal data cleaning needed

---

## 🧠 Model Development Steps

1. **Data Preparation** – Clean and structure historical order data  
2. **Model Selection** – Choose an appropriate forecasting algorithm  
3. **Architecture Design** – Build the model pipeline  
4. **Training** – Train the model on past order behavior  
5. **Evaluation** – Measure accuracy using relevant metrics  
6. **Iteration** – Improve model performance iteratively  
7. **Deployment** – Launch for business integration  
8. **Monitoring** – Ongoing performance tracking and updates
